# 📄 Enterprise Document Intelligence System using RAG

An end-to-end **Enterprise Document Question Answering System** built using **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
This project enables users to upload enterprise documents (PDF/DOCX) and query using natural language questions, getting **precise answers that are strictly rooted in the uploaded documents**.

This project is designed as a **resume-level, recruiter-ready AI project** using only **free and open-source software**.

## 🚀 Why This Project?

In actual enterprise settings, critical information is dispersed through:
- Policies
- Contracts
- Reports
- Technical writing

Current chatbots:
- **Don't handle private documents**
- **Hallucinate answers**
- **Can't trace sources**

This project addresses these issues by leveraging **LLMs + Vector Databases** with **RAG**, allowing for:
- **Accurate answers**
- **Zero hallucination**
- **Full source tracing**
